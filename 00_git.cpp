The old man and the sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like ... HUGE... The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he's the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honestly if you were in a boat for eight four days, it'd be hard to NOT catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say. "Parents Just Don't Understand". So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out. Holding Santiago's fishing gear. Making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who use to bump uglies with Marilyn Monroe.The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he's going way out into the Gulf Stream. Way Out north of Cuba. Lady Luck is returning.
