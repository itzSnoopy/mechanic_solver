On the eighty fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines and by noon gets bites from what feels like a big ass fish.He's sure it's a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can't pull the monster in. Santiago's leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he's bloody and beat Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him "Brother" or maybe even "bro". It's sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin' EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It's a mess. Super gross.
